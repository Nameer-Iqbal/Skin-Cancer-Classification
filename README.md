# Skin-Cancer-Classification
The Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000 dataset provides dermoscopic images of
skin lesions, categorized into seven distinct classes, to facilitate automated skin lesion diagnosis using
deep learning methods. This project involves the development and comparison of two deep learning
models: EfficientNet and a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), for the classification of these
dermoscopic images.
The primary objective of this project is to classify dermoscopic images of skin lesions into seven
categories using advanced deep learning models. The challenge lies in achieving high accuracy in
classification despite the inter-class similarities and intra-class variabilities of the skin lesions.
Additionally, the performance of a pre-trained model (EfficientNet) is compared with a custom-built
CNN to evaluate their effectiveness and efficiency.
